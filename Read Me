There are 3 files that need to be run in order- 1st, 2nd and 3rd, to generate the result as required.

The 1st file reads the train.data file. A peptide as mentioned in the code decribes the bracket that is being taken in consideration of size 17. 8 X's are added on both side of the protein sequence. Every peptide is desribed by a 17x21 matrix which is then rolled over to create a binary pattern. The binary pattern is classified as interactive or not based on the middle element of the peptide. We thus get 49,307 binary patterns which are then saved as a pkl file by the name 'dataready2.pkl'.

The 2nd file reads the 'dataready2.pkl' file. It converts the data in the numpy format as required in the SVM for its input. 'binary' is a matrix of (49,307 x 357) and 'interactive' is a vector of 49,307. The model is trained with the parameters c=4, gamma=0.0001 and class_weight='balanced' (to get the best accuracy). The test file was the imported and converted into the required binary pattern form, and then tested by our model. The predictions were saved in a file called 'predictions.csv'.

The 3rf file reads 'predictions.csv' and converts the True & False format to +1 & -1 format as required, which is then saved in the file named 'output.csv'.

Warning: Absolute paths are used in the code which will have to be changed.
